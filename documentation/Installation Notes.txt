+ FIRST INSTALLATION +
+--------------------+

Simply unzip folder OptImage-x.x.x.zip to the location where you usually put Matlab code, and run the file "optimage.m" in Matlab.

If Matlab asks whether to add the folder to the path or change folder, either option is good because optimage will anyway start by adding the necessary folders to the path.

It is recommended however to add permanently the main OptImage folder to the Matlab path, so the program can be started by simply typing "optimage".

If there is no OptImage license on the computer yet, here is the procedure for getting and activating a new license:
- Run "optimage". A dialog will apear, press "Request a license number". Copy the identifier that appears and press ok.
- Send this number to your OptImage provider, who will send you your license number in return.
- Run "optimage" again. This time press 'Activate your license', copy the license number in the field and press ok.

+ UPGRADE TO A NEW VERSION +
+--------------------------+

Upgrading to a new version basically consists in removing the previous version and replacing by the new version.

However, custom scripts might have been saved in the tpview/tpview-scripts sub-folder. They should be copied in the corresponding sub-folder of the new folder.

Also the Matlab path should be changed to replace the old folder by the new one. Alternatively, it is possible to rename folder OptImage-x.x.x to simply OptImage.
